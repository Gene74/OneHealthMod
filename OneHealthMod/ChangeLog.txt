Version 1.0.2

Version 1.0.1
==============
- Can now be activated in Game->Options->Mods

- At the start of a new game health is being reduced to 1, 
  but right when you check you will see it goes up to 2 again and stays there.

- It could also be that a health amount of 3 is shown right after applied 
  but it will go down to 2 after a short time (few seconds in my tests).


Version 1.0.0
==============
- When pressing F9 health gets reduced to the minimum (2) without gettig killed.
